# Assignment 2 - Regression (Expander_data.csv)

    • Develop a model, to predict the column 'Discharge Pressure (psig)' minimizing ‘rmse’ loss function
    • You are encouraged to try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative results
    • Please refrain from using very complex architectures in case of deploying deep learning algorithms
    • You’re allowed to do any feature engineering/feature selection you deem necessary
    • We will use a test set to check the model performance
