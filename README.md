# Assignment 2 - Regression (Expander_data.csv)

    • Develop a model, to predict the column 'Discharge Pressure (psig)' minimizing ‘rmse’ loss function
    • You are encouraged to try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative results
    • Please refrain from using very complex architectures in case of deploying deep learning algorithms
    • You’re allowed to do any feature engineering/feature selection you deem necessary
    • We will use a test set to check the model performance
# part 1 using multiple linear regression
10 % of the mean value of the label is greater than to the RMSE
#Bad assumptions: We made the assumption that this data has a linear relationship, but that might not be the case. Visualizing the data may help you determine that.
#Poor features: The features we used may not have had a high enough correlation to the values we were trying to predict.

# Root Mean Squared Error: 2.45339185851863
